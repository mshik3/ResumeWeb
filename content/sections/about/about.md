I've been a software engineer for 5+ years, working at Prime Video, Venmo, and now Discord. 

I'm a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. 

Now that we have the boring stuff out of the way, here's some real stuff about me..

I love playing sports and have recently picked up beach volleyball. I regularly play golf, though I suck at it, and I'm a very competitive tennis player even though I haven't competed since high school lol

I play video games all the time after work like Old School Runescape, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Civilization VI, Minecraft, and Skyrim. 

I absolutely love traveling and am always looking for new places to discover in this big, beautiful world. Just this year, I've lived a month in Los Angeles, visited Nashville, San Francisco, New York City, and Colorado. With much more to come :)
